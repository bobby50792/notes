# Deep Dive into Continuity

## **Continuity of Real Numbers**

**Completeness Property:**  

Every nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above (or below) has a least upper bound (or greatest lower bound).



**Monotone Convergence Theorem:**  

Every monotonic (non-decreasing or non-increasing) and bounded sequence of real numbers is convergent.  
$$
\begin{equation*}
a_n \nearrow, \quad a_n \le M \implies \lim_{n \to +\infty} a_n = \sup_{n \ge 1} a_n
\end{equation*}
$$
**Nested Interval Theorem:**  

Every sequence of nested closed and bounded intervals has a nonempty intersection.
$$
\begin{equation*}
[a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}] \subseteq [a_n, b_n] \implies \bigcap_{n \ge 1} [a_n, b_n] \ne \varnothing
\end{equation*}
$$


## Closed Set

A subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is called a **closed set** if it is closed under limits, that is:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\text{If } a_n \in A \text{ and } \lim_{n \to +\infty} a_n \text{ exists, then } \lim_{n \to +\infty} a_n \in A.
\end{equation*}
$$


### Theorems

1. $K \subset \mathbb{R}$ is a bounded closed set if and only if **every sequence** in $K$ has a convergent subsequence whose limit also lies in $K$.
	$$
	\begin{equation*}
	K \text{ is bounded and closed } \iff
	\forall \{x_n\} \subset K, \exists \{x_{n_k}\} \text{ such that } x_{n_k} \to x^* \in K.
	\end{equation*}
	$$



2. Let $f$ be a **continuous function** on a **nonempty bounded closed set** $K \subset \mathbb{R}$.  Then the image set $f(K)$ is also a nonempty bounded closed set.  Therefore, $f$ attains both its **maximum** and **minimum** on $K$.
	$$
	\begin{equation*}
	\exists x_{\max}, x_{\min} \in K
	\quad \text{s.t.} \quad
	f(x_{\max}) = \max_{x \in K} f(x), \quad
	f(x_{\min}) = \min_{x \in K} f(x).
	\end{equation*}
	$$
	

## Bolzano–Weierstrass

Every bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence.
$$
\begin{equation*}
\text{If } (a_n) \text{ is bounded in } \mathbb{R}, 
\text{ then there exists a subsequence } (a_{n_k})
\text{ such that } \lim_{k \to +\infty} a_{n_k} \text{ exists.}
\end{equation*}
$$


## **Cauchy Convergence Criterion**

A real sequence $\{a_n\}_{n \ge 1}$ **converges if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence**, that is:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\forall \varepsilon > 0, \, \exists N > 0 \text{ such that } 
\forall n \ge N, \, \forall p \ge 1, \, |a_{n+p} - a_n| < \varepsilon.
\end{equation*}
$$


## **Theorem (Banach Fixed Point Theorem / Contraction Mapping Theorem)**

Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ be a non-empty closed set.  Suppose $F: A \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfies:

1. $F(A) \subseteq A$;

2. (**Contraction**) There exists a constant $0 < \lambda < 1$ such that  
   $$
   \begin{equation*}
   |F(x) - F(y)| \le \lambda |x - y|, \quad \forall x, y \in A.
   \end{equation*}
   $$
   

Then there exists a **unique** point $x^* \in A$ such that $F(x^*) = x^*$.  Moreover, for any $x_0 \in A$ and any integer $n \ge 1$, we have  
$$
\begin{equation*}
|F^n(x_0) - x^*| \le \frac{\lambda^n}{1 - \lambda} |F(x_0) - x_0|.
\end{equation*}
$$


## **Intermediate Value Property**

If $f$ is continuous on the interval $[a,b]$ and $f(a) \ne f(b)$,  then every real number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$  is attained as a function value of $f$ on $[a,b]$.



### Theorems

1. If a function $f$ is monotonic on an interval $I$,  then $f$ is continuous **if and only if** $f(I)$ is an interval.
	$$
	\begin{equation*}
	f \text{ is continuous } \iff f(I) \text{ is an interval.}
	\end{equation*}
	$$
	

2. All elementary functions are continuous.

3. If $f$ is a continuous and injective (one-to-one) function on an interval $I$,  then $f$ is strictly monotonic.
	$$
	\begin{equation*}
	\text{Continuous and injective } \Rightarrow \text{ Monotonic.}
	\end{equation*}
	$$
	

## **Uniform Continuity**

A function $f$ is said to be **uniformly continuous** on a set $K$,  if for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta_\varepsilon > 0$ such that  

$$
\begin{equation*}
\forall x, y \in K, \quad |x - y| < \delta_\varepsilon \implies |f(x) - f(y)| < \varepsilon.
\end{equation*}
$$


### Theorems

1. If a function $f$ is continuous on a nonempty bounded closed set $K \subset \mathbb{R}$,  then $f$ is **uniformly continuous** on $K$.
