# Infinitesimals, Big O, Small o

## Infinitesimal

A function $f(x)$ is said to be an **infinitesimal** as $x \to c$,  if
$$
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = 0.
\end{equation*}
$$


A function $f(x)$ is said to be a **bounded quantity** as $x \to c$ if there exists $M > 0$ and a deleted neighborhood $W$ of $c$ such that for all $x \in W \cap I$,
$$
\begin{equation*}
|f(x)| \le M.
\end{equation*}
$$


## Big O

When $x \to c$, if $f(x) = O(g(x))$, it means:

There exists $M > 0$ and a deleted neighborhood $W$ of $c$ such that  for all $x \in I \cap W$, we have $|f(x)| \le M |g(x)|$.



If $f_1 = O(g)$ and $f_2 = O(g)$ as $x \to c$, then  $f_1 + f_2 = O(g).$

If $f_1 = O(g_1)$ and $f_2 = O(g_2)$ as $x \to c$, then  $f_1 f_2 = O(g_1 g_2).$



When $x \to c$, if $f$ and $g$ are of the **same order**, denoted  $f = \Theta(g), \quad x \to c,$  it means:

$$
\begin{equation*}
f = O(g) \text{ and } g = O(f),
\end{equation*}
$$



that is, there exist $M > 0$ and a deleted neighborhood $W$ of $c$ such that  for all $x \in W$,  
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{M} |g(x)| \le |f(x)| \le M |g(x)|.
\end{equation*}
$$


## Small o

When $x \to c$, if $f(x) = o(g(x))$, it means:  

For every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a deleted neighborhood $W$ of $c$ such that  for all $x \in W$,  
$$
\begin{equation*}
|f(x)| \le \varepsilon |g(x)|.
\end{equation*}
$$


If $f_1 = o(g)$ and $f_2 = o(g)$ as $x \to c$,  then  $f_1 + f_2 = o(g).$

If $f_1 = o(g_1)$ and $f_2 = O(g_2)$ as $x \to c$,  then  $f_1 f_2 = o(g_1 g_2).$



## Asymptotic equivalence

When $x \to c$, functions $f$ and $g$ are said to be **asymptotically equivalent**,  written as $f \sim g$, if  
$$
\begin{equation*}
f = g + o(g).
\end{equation*}
$$


That is, for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a deleted neighborhood $W$ of $c$ such that  for all $x \in W$,  
$$
\begin{equation*}
|f(x) - g(x)| \le \varepsilon |g(x)|.
\end{equation*}
$$


### Theorems

1. If $x \to c$, and  $ f + o(f) = G + o(g), \quad G = O(g), $  then  $ f = G + o(g)$.
2. If $x \to c$, and $f$ is equivalent to $g$,  then $g$ is equivalent to $f$.
3. If $x \to c$, and $f$ is equivalent to $g$,  and $g$ is equivalent to $h$,  then $f$ is equivalent to $h$.
